<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq">
<strong>How do I create a family?</strong>
<p>After signing up as a guardian, tap the Family tab and select "Create Family." Give your family a name, then invite members by sharing the join code.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>What are the different roles?</strong>
<p><strong>Guardians</strong> have full control — they create nags for anyone, set policies, and view family reports. <strong>Participants</strong> can create nags for any family member and respond to their own. <strong>Children</strong> can only receive and respond to nags, with COPPA-compliant safeguards.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>How do reminders escalate?</strong>
<p>Nagz uses a five-phase escalation: initial delivery, due-soon reminder, soft overdue follow-up, bounded push-back for repeated misses, and guardian review for unresolved tasks. Every step respects quiet hours and daily caps.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>Can I set up a child account?</strong>
<p>Yes. Children under 13 require guardian consent before their account is activated (COPPA compliance). Create the child account from your guardian profile and complete the consent flow.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>I'm not receiving push notifications.</strong>
<p>Check that notifications are enabled in your device Settings for the Nagz app. Also verify that your quiet hours window isn't currently active — reminders are paused during quiet hours.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>I'm not receiving SMS reminders.</strong>
<p>SMS requires explicit opt-in. Go to your profile settings and enable SMS notifications. Make sure your phone number is in US format. If you previously texted STOP, you'll need to re-opt-in.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>How do I block or report someone?</strong>
<p>Open the member's profile from the Family tab and tap "Block" or "Report Abuse." Blocking immediately prevents that member from sending you nags or notifications. Abuse reports are reviewed by our moderation team.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>How do I delete my account?</strong>
<p>Go to Settings and select "Delete Account." Your data will be purged or anonymized within 30 days, except records required for legal and safety compliance.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>How do I export my data?</strong>
<p>Go to Settings and select "Export My Data." You'll receive a complete export of your account information, family memberships, nags, events, preferences, and consent records.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>Is the "meds" category medical advice?</strong>
<p>No. The "meds" category is a scheduling label only. Nagz does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, dosing guidance, or clinical decision support of any kind.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>What does the AI do with my data?</strong>
<p>The AI collects excuse text and status updates that you submit, summarizes them for the nag creator, and can issue bounded follow-up prompts. All AI actions are logged, auditable, and bounded by guardian-configured policies. AI mediation requires your explicit consent, which you can revoke at any time.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
<strong>Is Nagz free?</strong>
<p>Yes. Nagz is free with no ads and no in-app purchases.</p>
</div>
