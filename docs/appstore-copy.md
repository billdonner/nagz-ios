## Description (4000 chars max)

Nagz is an AI-powered family reminder app that helps parents and kids stay on top of tasks, chores, and responsibilities. Create "nags" for family members, track progress, and let smart escalation handle the follow-ups so you don't have to repeat yourself.

**Family-First Design**

Set up your family with different roles. Guardians have full control — create nags for anyone, set policies, and view family reports. Participants can create and respond to nags. Children receive age-appropriate reminders with COPPA-compliant safeguards.

**Smart Escalation**

Nagz uses a five-phase escalation system: initial delivery, due-soon reminder, soft overdue follow-up, bounded push-back for repeated misses, and guardian review for unresolved tasks. Every step respects quiet hours and daily notification caps. No more nagging — the app does it for you.

**AI Mediation**

When someone submits an excuse or status update, AI summarizes it for the nag creator. Tone is configurable — supportive, neutral, or firm. All AI actions are logged, auditable, and bounded by guardian-configured policies.

**Gamification**

Earn points for completing tasks on time. Family leaderboards and weekly reports keep everyone motivated. Guardians can see who's on track and who might need a nudge.

**Siri Shortcuts**

Create and complete nags with your voice. "Hey Siri, create a nag" or "Hey Siri, mark my homework done." Works with Shortcuts app for automation.

**Push Notifications & SMS**

Get notified on your terms. Push notifications are instant. SMS reminders are available for family members who opt in. Quiet hours ensure no one gets buzzed at bedtime.

**Safety Controls**

Block and report family members. Guardian consent required for child accounts. All moderation actions are logged. Abuse reports are reviewed promptly.
